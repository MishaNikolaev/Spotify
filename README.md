**I tried to do application with media3 and i did this, but this project is poor because he has just media player and firebase without architecture pattern. 
Maybe this app will be example for design or media player.**

At first, there are auth screens (design and nothing at all). You can find this screens in folder presentation -> firstScreen.kt (or chooseThemeScreen.kt)

Next is the auth screen. There are 2 screens: sign up (RegisterScreen.kt) and sign in (SignInScreen.kt). I did this with Firebase. User who register in sign up screen can sign in with his data.
``` Kotlin
  private fun signUp(auth : FirebaseAuth, email: String, password: String){
    auth.createUserWithEmailAndPassword(email, password)
        .addOnCompleteListener{
            if (it.isSuccessful){
                Log.d("MyLog", "Sign Up successful")
            }
            else{
                Log.d("MyLog", "Sign Up exception")
            }
        }
}
```

P.S. I disabled sign in screen that i can fast forward to main part of app ( i didn't disable showing auth pages).

```Kotlin
  private fun signIn(auth : FirebaseAuth, email: String, password: String){
    auth.signInWithEmailAndPassword(email, password)
        .addOnCompleteListener{
            if (it.isSuccessful){
                Log.d("MyLog", "Sign In successful")
            }
            else{
                Log.d("MyLog", "Sign In exception")
            }
        }
}
```

In firebase console this looks like:

Then i did bottom bar with three screens - home (where i did nothing), search (all files in news package) and person (HomeScreenUI.kt). 
All about media player locate in data -> song_data package. 

Rest of screens:
